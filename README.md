# DeepVariant

DeepVariant is an analysis pipeline that uses a deep neural network to call
genetic variants from next-generation DNA sequencing data.

## About DeepVariant

For technical details describing how DeepVariant works please see our
[preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/21/092890).

![DeepVariant workflow](docs/DeepVariant-workflow-figure.png?raw=true "DeepVariant workflow")

Briefly, we started with GIAB reference genomes, for which there is high-quality
ground truth available. Using multiple replicates of these genomes, we produced
tens of millions of training examples in the form of multi-channel tensors
encoding the sequencing instrument data, and then trained a TensorFlow-based
image classification model ([inception-v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567)) to
assign genotype likelihoods from the experimental data produced by the
instrument. Read additional information on the [Google Research
blog](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/12/deepvariant-highly-accurate-genomes.html).

## Support

The [Genomics team in Google Brain](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/genomics/)
actively supports DeepVariant and are always interested in improving the quality
of DeepVariant. If you run into an issue, we recommend you follow one of two
approaches to getting the issue resolved.

If you have found a bug in DeepVariant - i.e., the code itself needs to be
fixed - please report the problem on our [Issue
tracker](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues). Make sure to add enough
detail to your report that we can reproduce the problem and fix it. We encourage
including links to snippets of BAM/VCF/etc. files that provoke the bug, if
possible. Depending on the severity of the issue we may patch DeepVariant
immediately with the fix or roll it into the next release.

If you have general questions about DeepVariant usage, please post your question
to [BioStars](https://www.biostars.org/), adding the tag 'deepvariant'. We
monitor [BioStars posts tagged with
DeepVariant](https://www.biostars.org/t/deepvariant/) and will respond as needed
there.
